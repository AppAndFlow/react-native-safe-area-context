You should add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component. You may need to add it in other places like the root of modals and routes when using [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens).

Note that providers should not be inside a `View` that is animated with `Animated` or inside a `ScrollView` since it can cause very frequent updates.

### Example

```tsx
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>{/*...*/}</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

### Props

Accepts all [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props) props. Has a default style of `{flex: 1}`.

#### `initialMetrics`

Optional, defaults to `null`.

Can be used to provide the initial value for frame and insets, this allows rendering immediately. See [optimization](/docs/optimizations) for more information on how to use this prop.
